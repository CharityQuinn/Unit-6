# Unit-6
Giphy App

This project allows a user to pull up pictures of bands.  These pictures will animate if clicked.  It takes time based on internet speeds.  It will also allow the user to search for band of their choosing.

This project will be useful if you do not know what your favorite band looks like and where and what types of things the band does to advertise themselves.

If you have any questions, please Slack me a message.
I will maintain this project but it is only here with the tremendous help from classmates, TAs and my tutor.
